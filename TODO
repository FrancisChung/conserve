* add manpage to automake

* Change to capnproto
  (Does add additional dependencies and may make things hard to install on
  older OS releases...)

* Log compression ratio per block

* Validate names are clean
* Validate name ordering 
* Assert correct name order while writing

* Write multiple top-level bands so that you can make more than one backup to an archive

* list bands
* list files in a band, or in a version

* Use structured problem reporting rather than fatal glog (in all cases)
* Backup and restore directories, symlinks, etc (maybe also fifos, devices)
* Give a warning status if we kept going past problems
* Add -k option to keep going after problems

* Maybe put indexes in a separate directory for easier listing?

* Test handling of various broken archives - perhaps needs some scripts or infrastructure to construct them
 * bzip decompression failure
 * missing lower layers

* Write to temporary file and move into place? 
  Actually needed, or is it better to just say that readers ought to cope 
  with truncated files, which are likely to happen anyhow.
