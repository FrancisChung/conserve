* Validate names are clean
* Validate name ordering 
* Assert correct name order while writing

* Write multiple top-level bands so that you can make more than one backup to an archive

* Use structured problem reporting rather than fatal glog (in all cases)
* Change to capnproto
* Backup and restore directories, symlinks, etc (maybe also fifos, devices)
* Give a warning status if we kept going past problems
* Add -k option to keep going after problems

* Maybe put indexes in a separate directory for easier listing?

* Test handling of various broken archives - perhaps needs some scripts or infrastructure to construct them
 * bzip decompression failure
